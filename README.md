# Alice Maze Solver

## What are Alize Mazes?

Alice Mazes are puzzles created by Robert Abbott. 

> These are called “Alice” mazes because they recall the scene in ***Alice in Wonderland*** where Alice eats a piece of cake with the sign “Eat Me” and grows larger, then she drinks from a bottle marked “Drink Me” and becomes smaller. These mazes won’t make you larger or smaller, but the distance you travel in a move will get larger or smaller. [^1]
